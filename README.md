# Forklift-Scheduled-Maintenance-Analysis
Master Program Capstone Project - Won Best MPS Project Award

## Project Description & Goal
### Definition of scheduled maintenance  
A scheduled maintenance is a periodic service on a forklift that is provided on a scheduled time period (every 60, 80 or 100 days). The maintenance or service consists of a check lists of brakes, oil steering, etc., much like that of when a car/truck/SUV receives a routine service. 


### The Overall Objective:  
The objective of this project is to identify current scheduled maintenance plan time periods for Raymond Counterbalance models (overall time between services) and analyze the costs associated with the forklifts.  Any plans with a pre-established time period already in place will be provided. The questions to be answered:  
•	What is the overall distribution of time between services?   
•	Do all forklifts participate in scheduled maintenance programs (Are there some with little or no SMs)?  
•	Break this down by customer, year, and model. Do any variables yield a significant difference in scheduled maintenance between groups?
Once a baseline time periods are discovered, attribute trucks to the appropriate Service time interval groups. Find out the total cost ownership for the Counterbalance Trucks and compare between the total costs between interval groups. Does cost differ among the different service intervals? What scheduled maintenance time period schedule gives the lowest total cost of ownership for the trucks? Are there any difference that can be attributed to the variables analyzed previously? If there are trucks with no SM done, do those trucks have a higher, lower or no different cost of ownership?   
•	What types of repairs seem to occur less frequent when using a scheduled maintenance plan?  
•	What types of repairs seem to occur less frequent by decreasing time interval in a scheduled maintenance plan?  
Finally provide a model to predict the optimal service time period based on the various factors provided. If scheduled maintenance proves to be too complex or data is incomplete, provide survival analysis of top 2 replaced parts (Wheels/tires, Motor brushes) over different replacement iterations.
